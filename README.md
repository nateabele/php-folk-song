The PHP Folk Song
=================

Hi! I've decided that PHP needs a folk song, and I'm gonna write one with the help of the internet! So far, all I have is a title: **The Ballad of Rasmus Lerdorf**.

How can _you_ help? I'm so glad you asked! Head on over to the wiki and jot down either an idea for something to write about on the **Ideas** page, or if you're feeling ambitious, you can write a whole verse on the **Verses** page.

Ready? Go!
